# It is a weather application created by using backend technologies like node.js and open weather api.

# We obtained an api key using open weather and used that key to fetch data for a particular city.

# We have used express js for build applications that cater every need without much line of codes.

# We have used hbs in the project for careting the need of template in html format.

# We have used nodemon for automatic running of node application and changes reflect immediately.

# utils -> weatherData provides me the data.
# error404 page is for error page.
# index page is for displaying information and managing the ui.
